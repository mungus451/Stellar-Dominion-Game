                            <p class="text-gray-300">Commanders, we've heard your feedback regarding the galactic economy. Wealth was accumulating at a rate that outpaced our credit sinks, making late-game progression less challenging. To address this, we have performed a major rebalance, increasing the costs of all Structures and Armory items by a factor of 1,000. This change is intended to make high-tier upgrades feel more meaningful and to provide a significant goal for established empires. We believe this will create a healthier, more competitive long-term environment for everyone. Thank you for your understanding!</p>

                            <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 mb-2">Posted: 2025-08-01</p>
                            <p class="text-gray-300">Today's update brings two major quality-of-life improvements. First, we're introducing <strong>Activity Experience</strong>. You will now gain a small amount of XP for training units, building structures, and purchasing from the armory to reward active players. Second, we have fixed a critical bug where players would not level up automatically. Now, simply visiting the <strong>Levels</strong> page will instantly process any pending level-ups you have earned. We have also granted retroactive XP to all players for their past actions to ensure fairness.</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-300">Commanders, a new strategic layer has been added to military progression! The Armory is now a tiered structure that must be upgraded via the 'Structures' page. Each level of your Armory unlocks access to a new tier of advanced weaponry for your soldiers. You must now invest in your empire's infrastructure to unlock its full military potential. Check the Structures page to begin upgrading your Armory and visit the Armory to see the new requirements for high-tier gear!</p>

                            <p class="text-gray-300">Today marks the single largest update to Stellar Dominion with the release of the Alliance Initiative.
